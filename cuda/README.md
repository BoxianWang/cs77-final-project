# CUDA CODE FOR GROUP 7
### Elliot Potter, Boxian Wang, Eric (Spencer) Warezak

## What code is from what sources?
We used two main sources:
1. The original Ray Tracing in One Weekend: https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#surfacenormalsandmultipleobjects/commonconstantsandutilityfunctions
2. The NVIDIA blog on converting to CUDA: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerated-ray-tracing-cuda/

sections 1-4 are almost entirely derived from the two sources.
The remaining sections are converted from the Ray Tracing in One Weekend book.
